# Restructure HDFS files

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RADAR-base/Restructure-HDFS-topic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RADAR-base/Restructure-HDFS-topic)

Data streamed to HDFS using the [RADAR HDFS sink connector](https://github.com/RADAR-CNS/RADAR-HDFS-Sink-Connector) is streamed to files based on sensor only. This package can transform that output to a local directory structure as follows: `userId/topic/date_hour.csv`. The date and hour is extracted from the `time` field of each record, and is formatted in UTC time. This package is included in the [RADAR-Docker](https://github.com/RADAR-CNS/RADAR-Docker) repository, in the `dcompose/radar-cp-hadoop-stack/hdfs_restructure.sh` script.

## Docker usage

This package is available as docker image [`radarbase/radar-hdfs-restructure`](https://hub.docker.com/r/radarbase/radar-hdfs-restructure). The entrypoint of the image is the current application. So in all of the commands listed in usage, replace `radar-hdfs-restructure` with for example:
```shell
docker run --rm -t --network hadoop -v "$PWD/output:/output" radarbase/radar-hdfs-restructure:0.4.0 -u hdfs://hdfs -o /output /myTopic
```
if your docker cluster is running in the `hadoop` network and your output directory should be `./output`.


## Local build

This package requires at least Java JDK 8. Build the distribution with

```shell
./gradlew build
```

and install the package into `/usr/local` with for example
```shell
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local
sudo tar -xzf build/distributions/radar-hdfs-restructure-0.4.0.tar.gz -C /usr/local --strip-components=1
```

Now the `radar-hdfs-restructure` command should be available.

## Command line usage

When the application is installed, it can be used as follows:

```shell
radar-hdfs-restructure --hdfs-uri <webhdfs_url> --output-directory <output_folder> <input_path_1> [<input_path_2> ...]
```
or you can use the short form as well like - 
```shell
radar-hdfs-restructure -u <webhdfs_url> -o <output_folder> <input_path_1> [<input_path_2> ...]
```

To display the usage and all available options you can use the help option as follows - 
```shell
radar-hdfs-restructure --help
```
Note that the options preceded by the `*` in the above output are required to run the app. Also note that there can be multiple input paths from which to read the files. Eg - `/topicAndroidNew/topic1 /topicAndroidNew/topic2 ...`. At least one input path is required.

By default, this will output the data in CSV format. If JSON format is preferred, use the following instead:
```shell
radar-hdfs-restructure --format json --hdfs-uri <webhdfs_url> --output-directory <output_folder>  <input_path_1> [<input_path_2> ...]
```

Another option is to output the data in compressed form. All files will get the `gz` suffix, and can be decompressed with a GZIP decoder. Note that for a very small number of records, this may actually increase the file size.
```
radar-hdfs-restructure --compression gzip  --hdfs-uri <webhdfs_url> --output-directory <output_folder> <input_path_1> [<input_path_2> ...]
```

By default, files records are not deduplicated after writing. To enable this behaviour, specify the option `--deduplicate` or `-d`. This set to false by default because of an issue with Biovotion data. Please see - [issue #16](https://github.com/RADAR-base/Restructure-HDFS-topic/issues/16) before enabling it.

Finally, while processing, files are staged to a temporary directory and moved to the output directory afterwards. This has the advantage of less chance of data corruption, but it may result in slower performance. Disable staging using the `--no-stage` option.
